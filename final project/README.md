Smart Crypto Watcher System

Building Scalable and Robust Trading Systems with DevOps
Building the infrastructure for a system capable of handling massive / big data and quickly changing data, in a reliable and accurate manner. 

📌Project idea:
A system that monitors real-time cryptocurrency data (such as Bitcoin) using CoinGecko's API.

This system:
1- Monitor cryptocurrency prices (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum).
2- Saves data so you can refer to it.
3- It sends you alerts if the price suddenly rises or falls.
4- Ensures that everything is running without interruption.
5- Logs data.

🧠 First: Understanding the Project
What the project offers/goals 🎯:

1- Live cryptocurrency monitoring
The system pulls prices every minute from the CoinGecko API.
2- Smart alert system (optional)
If the price changes significantly, an automatic notification is sent.
3- Robust DevOps infrastructure
Using tools like Docker, GitHub Action.
To automatically update the system, monitor performance, and ensure stability.
4- Scalable and Robust
The system operates without downtime even if the number of coins or users increases.

Why i choose the CoinGecko API?
1. It's free and easy to use.
No need to register any funds or cards.
You can get started right away without any complicated steps.
2. No need to register an API key.
Many websites require an API key, but CoinGecko lets you retrieve data directly without registering an account.
3. It provides real-time data.

🛠️ Project building steps
 We use the Agile method because it's suitable for incremental building and continuous monitoring, similar to DevOps.
📌 Sprint 1: Environment Setup
Install Python and VS Code.
Set up GitHub and Git.
Create an empty Python project.
📌 Sprint 2: Data Collection
Use the API from the currency website.
Fetch prices every 1-5 seconds.
Store the data in a file or simple database (SQLite or CSV).
📌 Sprint 3: Data Processing
Price Analysis.
Suggest when to buy or sell based on simple logic (e.g., if the price suddenly drops more than 5%).
📌 Sprint 4: Monitoring
Monitor the system: Is it working? Are there any errors?
Use tools like Grafana or Prometheus.
📌 Sprint 5: Scale and Optimize
Place the system within Docker.
Automate it for every update (CI/CD).
Deploy it on a simple cloud or on-premises.
📈 The end result:
A constantly operating system that monitors cryptocurrency prices, shows the user when the right time to buy or sell is, and is automatically updated and operates without interruption.
Conclusion :
⚠️ Important Note:
The focus of this project is not on AI itself, but on building the reliable environment that enables AI to run efficiently and continuously.
